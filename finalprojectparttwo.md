# User Research Protocol 
## Target Audience and Outreach Strategy

In [part 1](https://kisibor.github.io/portfolio/finalprojectpartone.html), I identified three user stories (students, nonprofits, local media). For the class presentation, I have decided to make students my target audience. As a result, interviewees had to be college or graduate students. Therefore,  when selecting participants to interview, I restricted my search to classmates and friends enrolled in higher education. 

## Interview Script: 
| Question                                                                                    | Goal (I asked the question to…)                                                  | Interviewee 1  Female, 20s-30s                                                                                                                                      | Interviewee 2 Female, 20s-30s                                                                                                        | Interviewee 3 Female, 20s-30s                                                                                |

# Key Findings 
- Too many charts and too many words
  * Interviews familiar with class felt that I would not have enough time to present all chart 
- Colors did not match the subject matter 
  * “[the color choices] are bright for a somber topic”
- No call to action
  * Interviews want to know what they could do to address the issue?

# Next steps: Updates to the Presentation
1. Change the colors to more muted colors
2. Streamline the text and use a large font. 
3. Select only 3 or 4 charts to display 
4. End with a clear call to action
