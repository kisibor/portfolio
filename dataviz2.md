# Brief Summary of Visualizations
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is a global organization dedicated to improving lives by strengthening policies. In line with their mission to “build better policies” they aggregate and share data to facilitate informed decision-making. The OECD published visualizations illustrating the debt-to-Gross domestic product (GDP) ratios of various nations. According to the OECD, this metric is meant to depict a country’s financial sustainability, so lower debt-to-GDP ratios mean the country is relatively more stable than other nations. The data has information from 1995 to 2021, as seen in the second figure “Trends in Government Debt from 1995 to 2021”. It appears that for nearly all nations government debt has been steadily increasing. Moreover, 2020 seems to have the highest level of debt for most nations. In that period, debt was 59% of Mexico’s GDP, 142% of Canada’s, and 160% of the United States of America’s. Furthermore, by examining the average year-to-year change in the debt-to-GDP ratio from 2010 to 2020 in the three North American countries, we noticed a significant jump in the ratio between 2019 and 2020. For example, the USA’s debt-to-GDP increased by 24%. This is inconsistent with typical changes in years prior, which had changes of less than 8%. The striking spike in government debt beginning in 2020 can be attributed to COVID-19 pandemic-related expenditures. This finding tracks with news reports [1] that include Mexico, Canada, and the USA among the list of countries that spend the most on the coronavirus.
