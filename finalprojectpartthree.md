# Writeup

User Research + Audience refinement

The user research findings indicated that the bright neon colors I was using in part two did not fit with the subject matter. I agreed and changed the colors from bright blue and orange to muted navy and gold colors. I was advised to consistently color code the racial groups across all charts. I implemented this suggestion and assigned a color to each of the racial groups I intended to highlight in the presentation. For example, navy blue for white populations and muted gold for Black populations. The user research interviewees also suggested I limit the charts I use to 2-3 in the interest of 60-second presentation format. I initially agreed and set up plans to make the changes. However, in developing the presentation I ended up adding in more charts to complete the narrative. Instead of removing charts as advised I decided to only highlight 3 in the 60-second presentation.

The final take away from the user research findings was the need for clear calls to action. In response to this, I now end my presentation with a firm call to action. Moreover, because my intended audience for this class presentation was Pittsburgh students, I had to change the type of call to action. Initially in part one, my objective was to make the call to action be broad policy initiatives: increased affordable housing and more investments in Black businesses. However, in part two, where I clearly defined the user stories — students, non-profits, and local media— my call to action changed to policies and practices within the purview of the type of user. For example, dedicate more programming to Black - wealth building for nonprofits. Furthermore, in part 3, I selected students as the primary audience and therefore developed a call to action within the obvious capabilities of students: contact local elected leaders and ask them to address Black population decline in Pittsburgh. This change in the call to action was the only modification I made because of the audience. The content remained the same and would have likely been the same if I chose to focus on any of the two user stories. However, when given the opportunity, I was able to highlight the home students contribute to gentrification in Pittsburgh's neighborhoods. Overall, I think all contributing factors were valuable for students to know when contacting elected officials.

Design Changes and Story Arc

In addition to the color changes, the other design changes I made involved the types of data visualizations I chose to represent the data. For example, illustrating gentrification, I initially planned to use a Sankey chart showing increased rent between 2010 and 2020. However, I opted for a simpler bar chart. This decision was informed by users (students) who, during user research, preferred charts that were more intuitive. Additionally, I incorporated important takeaways from the _Good Charts Workbook_. For example, the "points things out" strategy for persuasive storytelling. I did this by using red to highlight important figures and statements. Also, I used the classic story arc shared in the workbook. My setup was the general background on Pittsburgh both its demographics and the city's value of livability. Then I introduced the conflict: the city's livability standards are being challenged by the 10% decline in its Black population. And expanded on the issue by sharing contributing factors. Finally, I ended with the resolution, which was the call to action.
