Data visualizations by Kele Isibor

# About Me
My name is Kele Isibor and I study public policy and management at Carnegie Mellon Universityâ€™s HeInz College. In addition to public policy, I am interested in using data analytics to strengthen civil society groups. I think data visualizations are an incredible tool for telling stories and making data accessible to diverse audiences. Hence, I continue improve and increase my use of it in professional and personal projects.
